## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### **Phase 1: Preparation (5 minutes)**

#### 1.1 Generate Secret Key
```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```
**Save this key** - you'll need it for Railway environment variables.

#### 1.2 Get Cloudinary Credentials
- Sign up at https://cloudinary.com (free tier available)
- Get your credentials from dashboard:
  - Cloud Name
  - API Key
  - API Secret

#### 1.3 Commit and Push Your Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

### **Phase 2: Railway Setup (10 minutes)**

#### 2.1 Create Railway Project
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authenticate with GitHub if prompted
5. Select your `toyota_virtual_training` repository
6. Railway will automatically detect it's a Django app

#### 2.2 Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"Add PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway automatically creates and links the database
5. `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is created automatically

#### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables
Click on your **web service** (not the database), then **"Variables"** tab:

**Copy and paste these (update values):**
```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=toyota_training.settings_production
SECRET_KEY=<paste-your-generated-secret-key>
DEBUG=False
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
```

**Optional Email Settings:**
```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@rtmtoyota.ca
```

#### 2.4 Deploy
- Railway automatically deploys after environment variables are set
- Monitor deployment in **"Deployments"** tab
- Wait for build to complete (2-5 minutes)

---

### **Phase 3: Database Setup (5 minutes)**

#### 3.1 Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
```

#### 3.2 Login and Link Project
```bash
railway login
railway link
```
Select your project and service when prompted.

#### 3.3 Run Database Migrations
```bash
railway run python manage.py migrate
```

#### 3.4 Create Superuser Account
```bash
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

#### 3.5 (Optional) Seed Initial Data
```bash
railway run python create_initial_data.py
```

---

### **Phase 4: Verification (5 minutes)**

#### 4.1 Access Your Application
Your Railway URL will be: `https://[your-app-name].railway.app`

#### 4.2 Test Checklist
- [ ] Homepage loads successfully
- [ ] Static files (CSS/JS) are loading
- [ ] Admin login works at `/simple-admin/`
- [ ] Can login with superuser credentials
- [ ] Can upload images (tests Cloudinary)
- [ ] Training programs display correctly
- [ ] All regions work properly
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (green padlock)

---

### **Phase 5: Custom Domain (Optional - 10 minutes)**

#### 5.1 Add Domain in Railway
1. Go to your service ‚Üí **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Networking"**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `training.rtmtoyota.ca`
4. Railway provides DNS records

#### 5.2 Update DNS Records
Add the provided CNAME record to your DNS provider:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: training (or your subdomain)
Value: [provided by Railway]
TTL: 300 (or default)
```

#### 5.3 Update CSRF Settings
Edit `toyota_training/settings_production.py`:
```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    'https://training.rtmtoyota.ca',  # Add your domain
    'https://*.railway.app',
]
```

Then deploy the update:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add custom domain to CSRF trusted origins"
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy the changes.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment Failed

**Check:**
1. Build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify all required packages in `requirements_production.txt`
3. Ensure Python version is correct in `runtime.txt`

**Solution:**
```bash
# View detailed logs
railway logs

# Force rebuild
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force rebuild"
git push
```

### Issue: Static Files Not Loading

**Symptoms:** No CSS, broken layout

**Solution:**
1. Check deployment logs for `collectstatic` output
2. Verify `whitenoise` is in `requirements_production.txt`
3. Manually trigger:
   ```bash
   railway run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

### Issue: Database Connection Error

**Symptoms:** `OperationalError: could not connect to server`

**Solution:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL is added to Railway project
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` exists:
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```
3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   railway run python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Issue: Application Error 500

**Solution:**
1. Check logs for detailed error:
   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   ```
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check `SECRET_KEY` is set
4. Ensure `DEBUG=False`

### Issue: CSRF Verification Failed

**Symptoms:** `CSRF verification failed` on forms

**Solution:**
1. Add Railway domain to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in `settings_production.py`
2. Ensure cookies are being sent over HTTPS
3. Check `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` in production settings

### Issue: Images Not Uploading

**Symptoms:** Upload fails or images don't appear

**Solution:**
1. Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct
2. Test connection:
   ```bash
   railway run python -c "import cloudinary; cloudinary.config(); print('Connected!')"
   ```
3. Check Cloudinary dashboard for uploaded files
4. Verify `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Current Configuration
- **Workers:** 2 (configured in Procfile)
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds
- **Database Connections:** Pooled (600s max age)
- **Static Files:** Compressed by WhiteNoise

### Scaling Recommendations

**For Light Traffic (<1000 users/day):**
```
--workers 2
```

**For Medium Traffic (1000-5000 users/day):**
```
--workers 4
```

**For Heavy Traffic (>5000 users/day):**
```
--workers 4
# Consider upgrading to higher Railway plan
```

Update in `Procfile`:
```
web: gunicorn toyota_training.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 --timeout 30
```
